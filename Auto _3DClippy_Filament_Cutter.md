The servo uses standard servo motors and wires, however, the V+ and signal wire on the servo connected need to be reversed.  The servo wire will plug directly into the ICSP header on the 3DChameleon's electronics as shown here

## Notes

> Note, in order to use the plastic control horn in our 3DClippy design, you'll want use the 4 way plastic control horn and cut off 3 of the arms.  This will fit directly onto the servo shaft and allow the blade holder to move in and out of the cutter.  

> Also note, you'll want to power on the 3DChameleon with the servo attached... cycle it by loading/unloading filaments a few times to make sure the servo ends in the correct "blade out" position before you attach the control horn.  
That way no calibration is needed.  
Also make sure you use the provided knife blades and glue them into place all the way into the blade holder.
